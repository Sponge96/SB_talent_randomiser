# SB_talent_randomiser
Randomise your talents in the game Spellbreak with the use of Python's Random library.
Initailly used as a fun way to randomise and create some challenging gameplay for a few friends and Twitch live streamers but feel free to use or adapt.

This was my first real solo project in the early days of my Learning Python Masterclass course (Udemy); I really wanted a way to try and use the limit libraries I had been introduced to and I ended up with this.
